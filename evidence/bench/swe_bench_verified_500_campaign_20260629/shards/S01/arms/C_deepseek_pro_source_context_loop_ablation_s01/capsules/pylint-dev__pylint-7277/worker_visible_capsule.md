# SWE-bench Task pylint-dev__pylint-7277

Repository: pylint-dev/pylint
Base commit: 684a1d6aa0a6791e20078bc524f97c8906332390
Version: 2.15
Difficulty: <15 min fix

## Problem Statement

`pylint` removes first item from `sys.path` when running from `runpy`.
### Bug description

This is the line where the first item from sys.path is removed.
https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/ce7cccf96454fb6e286e4a8f38919733a0f28f44/pylint/__init__.py#L99

I think there should be a check to ensure that the first item is `""`, `"."` or `os.getcwd()` before removing.

### Configuration

_No response_

### Command used

```shell
Run programmatically to repro this, using this code:

import sys
import runpy

sys.path.insert(0, "something")

runpy.run_module('pylint', run_name="__main__", alter_sys=True)
```


### Pylint output

```shell
When using pylint extension which bundles the libraries, the extension add them to sys.path depending on user settings. Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.
```


### Expected behavior

Check if  `""`, `"."` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path

### Pylint version

```shell
pylint 2.14.5
```


### OS / Environment

_No response_

### Additional dependencies

_No response_
